Coding Standards:
- Follow PEP 8 style guide (I use autopep8 extension in vscode)
- snake_case for variable and function names.
- CamelCase for class names.
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes.
- Add inline comments when necessary to explain non-obvious code.
- Add required python packages in pyproject.toml.
- Increment version number upon substential update or milestone.

Testing and code review: -TO BE AGREED ON
- Minor changes can be merged to main directly.
- All major changes should go through a pull request.
- All pull requests must include tests for any new or modified code.
- Tests should be written using the unittest framework.
